## Description
Note-Taker is a project that does exactly what it sounds like, takes and saves notes for the user! When you first load the program, there will be a get started page. Once you click on the "Get Started" button you will then be taken to the notes.html page where you can now start adding notes. The user must type in a title and text in order to save the note. Once the note is saved, all notes will appear on the left hand side where the user has access, only able to see the title. The user can click on any note on the left hand side to view on the right. The user when looking at a saved note may click on the pencil/note icon to start a new note. On the left hand side the user may also delete any saved notes.
