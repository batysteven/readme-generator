# ReadMe-Generator

## Description
This application is used to making a professional readme.md file. The user will be prompt first for their name, github username, and email. After that the user will then be prompt for project title, description for the project, asked for step-by-step instructions for installation, and any instructions for usage and how to add screenshots to this section. These next sections will ask the user to confirm if they want to add any collaborators, if the user would like other developers to contribute, guidelines of how to do so, if the user would like to add any test and what they are, and if the user would like to add a license. The license has a link to view options but this readme-generator also gives a set of options to choose from. After this is complete the readme.md file will then generate in the dist folder for the user.
